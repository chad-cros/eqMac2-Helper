# eqMac2 Helper
Some applescripts to help with the eqMac2 crackling

While we wait for either the dev of eqMac2 to release his new version, or Apple fixes their
audio stuff, this simple script interfaces with spotify, and restarts eqMac2 at the end of a song.
This makes the short pause that happens when selecting a new audio device or restarting the
app altogether not cause an annoying gap in the song. More features to come!

- Note: While currently this script is only compatible with Spotify, it could easily be expanded in the future
to include other players such as iTunes.
