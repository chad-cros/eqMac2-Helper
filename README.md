# eqMac2 Helper
Some applescripts to help with the eqMac2 crackling

This uses the legacy eqMac2 (found at https://github.com/nodeful/eqMac2) app over the newer eqMac app (found at eqMac.app) 

- Note: While currently this script is only compatible with Spotify, it could easily be expanded in the future
to include other players such as iTunes.
